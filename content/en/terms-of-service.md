# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "the Site" or "We"). Before diving into our services, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're totally agreeing to and accepting these terms. 😉

## 1. Service Overview
The Site offers users awesome paid subscription content and member services! This includes, but isn't limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions. Heads up: some content is only for our subscribed members.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- Users need to provide a valid email address and set a password to register for an account.
- Users are fully responsible for their account's security and all activities that happen under it. **Absolutely no transferring or sharing your account, got it?**
- The Site has the right to suspend or terminate a user's account if they violate these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Subscription services are billed monthly/annually, with fees clearly displayed on the checkout page.
- All payments are processed through third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). FYI, the Site doesn't store your payment info.
- Subscriptions will **automatically renew** unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends.
- Our **14-day refund policy** is pretty sweet: if you're a first-time subscriber and not stoked with the service within 14 days of purchase, you can totally apply for a full refund. Just hit us up via the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why. Each user gets one refund chance. If it's past 14 days or not your first subscription, payments are **non-refundable**, unless legally required.

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
- All original content on this site (that's hubtoday, folks!) is **copyrighted by us**. Unauthorized copying, reprinting, or commercial use is a big no-no.
- Users only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** this content for personal learning and reading.
- Got commercial use or major citation needs? Please hit us up for authorization first!

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- Users are **prohibited** from uploading, posting, or distributing any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights. Seriously, don't do it!
- **Bulk downloading, scraping, or cracking member content** using technical means is also **strictly forbidden**.
- The Site has the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban violating users**. 🙅‍♀️

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- We reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate some or all services at any time, without prior notice. Just a heads up!
- If content becomes temporarily inaccessible due to force majeure, server issues, or third-party service interruptions, the Site **will not be liable for any compensation**.

## 7. Disclaimer
- The information provided by the Site is purely for reference and **doesn't constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical, etc.).
- The Site is **not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users might experience from using its content or services. No hard feelings!

## 8. Governing Law
- These Terms of Service are governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
- For any disputes arising from or related to these terms, both parties should try to resolve them amicably first. If that doesn't work out, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California.
